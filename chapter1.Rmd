# About the project

I am looking forward to this course and hoping that the course will elevate my data handling skills. Especially I look forward to be able to learn R. Getting to this point that I write to this very file was a little frustrating process, since there were a couple of errors from RStudio. Luckily I was able to tackle them after all.
